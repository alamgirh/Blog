Writing a mathematical expression on a website is so easy and so simple. MathJax allows you to include mathematics in your web pages. You need to include the following in the following in your HTML file.

```HTML
<head>
....
....
....
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    	MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']]}});
  	</script>
  	<script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML">
 	</script>
</head>
```

After that, you can write anything using $\LaTeX$ and your browser will show awesome mathematics!
