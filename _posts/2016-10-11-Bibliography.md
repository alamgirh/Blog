When we read hundreds of scientific articles, it is difficult to find specific articles on our computer where we saved it. Sometimes it is difficult to remember the summary of that paper or what were the important points that we looked at that paper. Now, I will tell you two ways to manage your articles.

- [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) is an open source bibliography reference manager. JabRef works equally well on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can install JabRef in your computer and manage easily all your articles.

- I created a GitHub repository where I included a .tex file papers.tex and some .bib files. In my .bib files, I put some comments about the papers that help me to remember the paper and also included the path of the papers from my computer where they are saved. It helps me to find that paper from my computer using one single click and remember the paper within a while!
